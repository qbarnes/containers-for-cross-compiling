This repo provides containers with cross-compilation environments
for building binaries for ARM aarch64, ARM 32-bit, MS-DOS, and
Microsoft Windows 32-bit and 64-bit.

I reference these containers in other repos for use with GitHub Actions.

Feel free to use the published container images for your own GitHub
Actions or by building them yourself locally.

If you find any problems or have suggestions, please
[submit a PR](https://github.com/qbarnes/containers-for-cross-compiling/pulls).
